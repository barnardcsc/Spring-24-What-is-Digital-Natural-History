# Spring-24-What-is-Digital-Natural-History
Demonstration of I-Naturalist, I-DigBio.org, etc. and a discussion of the intersection between nature and digital spaces.

This workshop is taught by Hilary Callahan, Ann Whitney Olin Professor of Biological Sciences at Barnard College.

This workshop demonstrates one highly accessible app (such as I-Naturalist) and how it interfaces with a more technical platform (I-DigBio.org) and explicitly discusses how there are opportunities for amateurs and aspiring professionals. We look mostly at plants and maybe a few insect examples, like butterflies and other pollinators. For those interested in the computing and data science side, you can also see some specimens from Barnard's herbarium to show how the digital world is built firmly on the foundation of material and analogue predecessors. All levels welcome.
